# Course Description: 
  
This course is designed to develop an understanding of the three pillars of  modern microeconomic theory: consumer behavior, producer behavior, and market competition. The material in this course provides the foundation for studying issues in a wide variety of fields in economics, including labor, health, education, industrial organization, trade, environmental economics, and other fields, and it is essential for further study in economics. 

We start with a review of material from Introduction to Microeconomics (EC 201) by discussing supply and demand and how these interact to determine market equilibrium. After we develop the mathematical tools we need for the class from calculus, we will proceed to study consumer theory. We will gain an understanding of how consumers’ preferences and budgets lead to their consumption choices and the derivation of individual and market demand curves. We will then study producer theory and learn how available technologies lead to cost functions and supply curves. Having gained an understanding of both the demand and the supply sides of economies, we proceed to study the interactions of consumers and firms in different types of markets.

No makeup exams will be given. In the case of a missed midterm due to unanticipated emergency situations, the student will be allowed to put the weight of the missed test on the final exam, provided I am notified as soon as possible and verification of the emergency is given. A missed final due to an unanticipated emergency may be handled with an “incomplete” for the course.  Again, this will require timely notification and verification of the emergency and in case of the flu/COVID-19 it will require notification before the exam. Do not take this class if you already know you cannot make the final exam. Exam regulations, including rules for re-scheduling final exams can be found on the website https://registrar.uoregon.edu/calendars/examinations. If, based on the rules laid out on this website, you are in situation where you require a re-scheduling of the final exam for this class, you will have to let me know in a timely manner.

Any requests for re-grades on an exam must be submitted in writing within one week of when the exam is handed back. A re-grade request should include an argument of why you feel your answer was correct. Since exam questions are graded as a whole, I reserve the right to re-grade the entire question when a re-grade request is made.

# Academic Integrity:

Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please acquaint yourself with the Student Conduct Code, which is available at conduct.uoregon.edu. 

Among other things, it is not allowed to let another student complete your Acheive homework assignments or to copy answers to homework assignments from any source. Copying cheats you of the practice necessary to succeed on exams. If I observe that you copy homework answers or answer keys in any fashion, I will give you zero credit for all homework assignments for the class. If you have questions about the boundaries between working on homework assignments jointly and copying them, ask me for clarification.

During exams you may only you’re your book and class notes from Canvas. Any other forms of assistance or sources of information (including cellular phones and Google) are prohibited. Any violations of the Student Conduct Code will result in a failing grade for the course. In addition, an incident report will be filed with the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards.
